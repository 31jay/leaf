											"The Argument"


Two coworkers have a disagreement about a project they're working on. As the argument escalates, their voices become louder and more intense. One of them storms out of the room in frustration, leaving the other feeling hurt and betrayed. The next day, they must work together to find a way to resolve their differences and move forward.
