"The Coder's Lament"


Lines of code, endless and bright,
A programmer's work is never done.
Syntax errors, bugs in sight,
Debugging 'til the rising sun.

The keyboard clicks, a steady beat,
As thoughts are translated to code.
Logic flows, algorithms neat,
An art form for the tech abode.

But with each bug, frustration grows,
And time slips by like sand.
The coder's lament, nobody knows,
The struggle to make software grand.
