"The Programmer's Dream"


In the world of code and screens,
A programmer's dream is born.
An idea, a vision, something unseen,
A digital world, waiting to be born.

With keystrokes and logic, they weave
A tapestry of code and data,
A creation that's hard to believe,
A virtual world, a coder's opera.

Through each line, they breathe life
Into a digital universe.
The power to make worlds rife
With wonder, a programmer's verse.
