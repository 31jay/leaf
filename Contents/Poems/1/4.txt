"The Code Wizard"


In a land of computers and code,
Lives a wizard of digital realm.
With keystrokes and syntax, they explode
Into a world beyond the helm.

They speak a language few can know,
A magic that's beyond compare.
A digital sorcerer, with tricks to show,
A code wizard, beyond compare.

With each program, they weave a spell,
A digital world, beyond our sight.
They create, they shape, they quell,
And make the impossible right.

In a world of screens and code,
The code wizard reigns supreme.
A master of the digital abode,
A hero, in the programmer's dream.
