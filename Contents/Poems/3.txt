"The Debugging Blues"


I've got the debugging blues,
Sitting here, staring at my screen.
Trying to fix what I can't excuse,
Another bug, another scene.

The logic seems sound, but it's not,
There's something hidden, I know.
The program runs, but it's fraught,
With errors that refuse to go.

I'll keep digging, line by line,
Until I find the flaw.
I won't give up, it'll be just fine,
I'll fix it all, and more.
