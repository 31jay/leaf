									"The Ghost in the Attic"

Emily had always been fascinated by the idea of ghosts, so when her family moved into an old Victorian house, she was excited to explore it. But as she began to explore the attic, she realized that there was something strange going on. Every night, she heard strange noises and saw shadows moving across the walls. One night, as she was investigating, she saw a figure in the corner of the room. It was a ghostly woman, who told Emily that she had been trapped in the attic for centuries. Emily knew that she had to help the ghost, but she didn't know how. As she researched the history of the house, she discovered that the woman had been wrongly accused of a crime and sentenced to death. Emily realized that the only way to set the ghost free was to clear her name. With the help of her friends, she set out to uncover the truth and bring justice to the woman who had been trapped in the attic.
